Welcome to Prototype 2, a dynamic 3D platformer built in Unity that breaks away from traditional movement mechanics by replacing WASD controls with an innovative slingshot mechanic. Navigate floating islands, overcome obstacles, and strategically plan each launch to master this unconventional movement system.

### ⭐ Gameplay Mechanics ⭐

- **Slingshot Movement:**  
  Players propel themselves forward by aiming and launching their character using a slingshot mechanic. Each launch requires strategic thinking to land accurately on platforms and progress through the level.

- **Avoiding Bats (Lose Condition):**  
  The game introduces a high-stakes challenge—bats that follow the player when alerted. If the bats catch the player, it results in a loss. This adds an extra layer of urgency to each move, as players must be mindful of timing and precision to stay ahead.

- **Collectibles:**  
  Throughout the levels, various collectibles are placed as rewards for precise launches and well-executed maneuvers. Collect these items to explode and get rid of some bats to enhance your score.

### ⭐ Key Objectives ⭐

1. **Navigate Floating Islands:**  
   Use the slingshot mechanic to traverse from platform to platform in a carefully crafted 3D environment.

2. **Collect All Collectibles:**  
   Aim to collect items scattered throughout the level for a sense of accomplishment and an added challenge.

3. **Avoid Bat Swarms:**  
   Plan your movements carefully to avoid alerting the bats, and ensure they don’t catch up to you. Losing to the bats ends the game, so each launch must be well-timed.
